# Physiologically-Informed Predictability of a Teammate's Future Actions Forecasts Team Performance

This repository contains code for analyzing **synchrony, predictability, and performance** in multi-human teams. The analysis spans multiple modalities, including **EEG, pupil size, speech events, and remote controller actions**, alongside transformer-based modeling for remote controller action prediction.

## üìå Features

- **ISC Performance Analysis:** Computes **Inter-Subject Correlation (ISC)** for different data modalities, such as EEG, pupil size, and speech events, and examines their correlation with team performance.
- **Predicting Action Performance:** Analyzes the correlation between predicted remote controller actions and participants' actual actions.
- **Preprocessing Pipelines:** Provides tools to clean, normalize, and prepare data for analysis.
- **Transformer-Based Modeling:** Implements a **transformer-based predictive model** to forecast future remote controller actions of individual participants based on their team members' past physiological and behavioral data.
- **Plotting Utilities:** Includes visualization scripts for performance and synchrony analysis.

## üõ† Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YinuoQ/predictability_performance_and_ISC.git
cd synchrony_and_performance
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

## üöÄ Usage

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Running ISC Analysis
To compute performance correlation with ISCs using EEG, pupil size, and speech event data:

```bash
cd ISC_performance
python eeg_ISC_performance.py
python pupil_ISC_performance.py
python speech_event_ISC_performance.py
python action_ISC_performance.py
```

To plot ISC correlation with team performance:

```bash
python synchrony_plot.py
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Predicting Actions Using the Transformer Model
To generate training and testing data:

```bash
cd transformer/data
python generate_transformer_data.py
```

To train the transformer model on preprocessed data:

```bash
bash ./train.sh
```

To test the trained model:

```bash
bash ./test.sh
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Computing Predictability and Its Correlation with Team Performance
To compute action predictability and its correlation with team performance:

```bash
cd predicted_action_performance
python action_performance.py
```

To plot predictability results:

```bash
python plot_predictability.py
```

To compute the correlation between performance, ISC, and predictability using mixed-effects models:

```bash
python correlations.py
```
